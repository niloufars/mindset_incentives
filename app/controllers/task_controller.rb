I don't have to be an expert philosopher or an expert in human perception for my perceptual faculties to operate correctly and give me knowledge. But the skeptic is still lurking in the wings. Lets suppose we accept all I've said, suppose we accept that the word knowledge, as it's used in ordinary language, fits with this sort of externalist account and can quite properly be used in the various loose ways I've described. That doesn't actually defeat the skeptic because the skeptic can say, 'Well, look. If what you say is right, if your beliefs are in fact true, then I'll accept that you know all these things in this ordinary language sense."

I'm walking along in Oxford one day, on my way to a lecture, and I get kidnapped and invatted. Some mad scientist extracts my brain and puts it in a vat. I forget about all this of course, I'm given the illusion of coming to a lecture. I look at this and I say, here's a hand, but actually, it's just a hand image. And now it looks like Putnam's approach isn't going to work. Because I learnt the use of the word hand by referring to real hands. So when I say hand I mean a real hand. I don't mean a hand image. In which case, I can raise the skeptical worry. Maybe this isn't a real hand. Maybe I am a brain in a vat."

And it's probably a good thing that we're made that way. Because if we weren't, then we'd be in serious trouble. Notice also that this approach goes well with contemporary externalism. The thought is that we shouldn't aim for all our beliefs to be such that we can justify them internally. We shouldn't expect to be able to work out internally the justification for everything we believe. Perhaps we have to rely on our animal nature that leads us inevitably to believe certain things and to trust in general that our faculties are thankfully more or less reliable. Of course that doesn't mean we should become undiscriminating and there remain big questions about how to distinguish between things that remain justified and things that aren't but if we want to hold out against the skeptic we probably have to be prepared to accept standards that are less than absolute."

When I look at this thing, I think there's an object there which is actually moving in space, and whose movement is systematically correlated with my perception, in such a way that my perceptions give a directly reliable indicator of where it is. I have an idea of the sort of causal interaction which is responsible for these perceptions, in terms of light shining on my hand, bouncing off, I see it with my eyes, and so forth. And that's a very different picture from the picture of some mad scientist manipulating electrodes or running some computer program which is bringing it about that my perceptions correlate as though there were an object there. So maybe I can make some sense of a God's eye point of view"

I'm not going to go further, I'm not going to try to explain why. Maybe it's god's action, maybe there's some sort of ethereal fluid that somehow brings it about.
